# NEURAL ARCHIVE // AI MASTERY LIVE

An immersive, first-person generative audio-visual experience built with **Three.js** and the **Web Audio API**. This project synthesizes a live DJ set and a 4K 3D wireframe environment in real-time, synchronized at 110 BPM.

## 🚀 Experience Features
- **Generative 3D Tunnel:** Infinite hexagonal wireframe geometry with procedural fog.
- **Real-Time Audio Synthesis:** No external MP3s. Audio is generated via CPU oscillators (Techno Kick & Vinyl Scratches).
- **110 BPM Sync:** Visual pulses and camera shakes are hard-coded to the beat.
- **Dynamic Member HUD:** Scans through AI Mastery network members with spatial shimmer FX.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Visuals:** Three.js (WebGL)
- **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock)
- **Audio:** Web Audio API (Procedural Synthesis)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🕹️ Usage
1. Click **"INITIALIZE CORE"** to establish the audio context.
